PRODUCT FEATURES

As the Product Manager for this project, my goal is to ensure this platform doesn't just record what happened, but tells you **why** it happened and **how** to improve. Since this is a personal, high-performance tool, we are stripping away the "noise" (multi-user features) and focusing on **Deep Insight and Behavioral Correction.**

Here is the "Product Requirements Document" for your personal TradeZella-style platform.

---

## 1. The Command Center (Main Dashboard)

The dashboard is the heartbeat of the platform. It must provide an immediate psychological "reset" or "alert" regarding your current performance.

* **Performance KPIs:** Real-time calculation of Net P&L, Win Rate, Profit Factor, and Average Risk/Reward (R-Multiple).
* **The Trading Calendar:** A classic monthly grid where each day is color-coded. Clicking a day reveals the narrative of that session.
* **Equity Growth Curve:** A line chart showing your account's journey. It must include a "Drawdown" overlay to visualize how much you’ve given back from your peaks.
* **The "Discipline Score":** A proprietary rating based on how well you followed your playbook (e.g., did you hit your stop loss? Did you enter at the right time?).

## 2. The Deep-Dive Journal (Trade Detail View)

When you review a trade, you aren't looking at numbers; you are performing an autopsy. This view must be the most detailed part of the app.

* **Visual Execution Map:** A candlestick chart that automatically plots your buy and sell orders. You need to see exactly where you entered relative to the price action.
* **The Narrative Log:** A rich-text area for "Pre-Trade Thoughts" (Why did I take this?) and "Post-Trade Reflection" (How did I feel?).
* **Planned vs. Realized R:** A visual bar showing what you *planned* to risk vs. what you *actually* lost. This highlights "slippage" and "hoping" (holding losers too long).
* **Intra-Trade MFE/MAE:** * **Maximum Favorable Excursion (MFE):** The most the trade was "in the green" before you closed it.
* **Maximum Adverse Excursion (MAE):** The most the trade was "in the red" before it worked.
* *PM Note:* This tells you if your stops are too tight or if you’re leaving too much money on the table.

## 3. The Analytics Engine (Filter & Slice)

This is where you find your "Edge." The platform must allow you to group trades by any variable to see where the money is actually coming from.

* **Variable Comparison:** A tool that compares performance by **Timeframe** (e.g., 5m vs 1h), **Asset** (e.g., NVDA vs SPY), or **Time of Day** (Opening Bell vs Power Hour).
* **Tag Cloud Analysis:** A breakdown of your **Setup Tags** (e.g., "Bull Flag") vs. your **Mistake Tags** (e.g., "Revenge Trade").
* **The "Expected Value" Calculator:** A dynamic stat that tells you: "If you keep trading exactly like this, how much will you have in 100 trades?"

---

## 4. The Strategy Playbook (Compliance)

A library of your "Rules." Every trade should be linked to a Playbook entry.

* **Setup Definitions:** A repository where you define your entry/exit criteria for specific strategies with "Gold Standard" screenshots for reference.
* **Compliance Tracking:** A percentage-based stat showing how often you actually stick to your defined rules. If your "Breakout" strategy has a 40% compliance rate, you know the problem is the trader, not the strategy.

---

## 5. Performance Reports (The Truth)

Weekly and Monthly automated summaries that summarize your behavior.

* **Mistake Cost Analysis:** A specific report that adds up all the money lost to "Mistake Tags."
* *Example:* "This month, FOMO cost you $1,200." This creates a heavy psychological impact to prevent future errors.


* **Trade Distribution:** A histogram showing your R-distribution. You want to see a "Fat Tail" of big winners and a "Hard Cut" of small, consistent losers.

### The "PM" Summary of Success

The platform is successful if, after 30 days of use, you can look at a chart and say: *"I make 80% of my money on Tuesday mornings trading 15-minute breakouts, and I lose it all back on Friday afternoons trading 1-minute reversals."*

### Observations

All trade inputs base information will be done as manual or csv import, nothing of platform connections for now.
All real charts integrations will not be done now, feature for future.
