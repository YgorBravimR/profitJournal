# Trading Risk Management - Rules & Path Simulation

## 1. Strategy Rules (Extracted from Flowchart)

### Risk Limits

| Scope         | Max Loss     |
|---------------|-------------|
| Per Operation | R$ 500.00   |
| Daily         | R$ 1,000.00 |
| Weekly        | R$ 2,000.00 |
| Monthly       | R$ 7,500.00 |

### Execution Constraints

| Rule              | Value          |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Minimum Stop      | 100 points     |
| Maximum Contracts | 20 contracts   |

### Operating Hours

09:01 to 17:00

### Position Sizing

The number of contracts per trade is derived from the risk amount and stop distance:

```
Contracts = Risk Amount / (Stop in points * Point Value per contract)
```

**Hard constraints apply after calculation:**
- If contracts > 20: **cap at 20** (actual risk will be lower than planned)
- If stop < 100 points: **widen stop to 100** and recalculate contracts

#### Example: WIN Mini-Index (R$0.20 per point per contract)

| Trade | Risk    | Stop 100pt | Stop 150pt | Stop 200pt | Stop 300pt |
|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| T1    | R$500   | 25 -> **20 (capped)** | 16 | 12 | 8 |
| T2    | R$250   | 12        | 8         | 6         | 4         |
| T3    | R$125   | 6         | 4         | 3         | 2         |
| T4    | R$125   | 6         | 4         | 3         | 2         |
| Gain mode | 30% of gains (variable) | depends on accumulated gains | — | — | — |

**Note:** At 100-point stops, Trade 1 hits the 20-contract cap (effective risk R$400 instead of R$500). Gain-mode trades use 30% of accumulated gains as risk, so contract counts vary and are recalculated per trade.

### Two Operating Modes

The strategy operates in one of two modes depending on the outcome of the **first trade** of the day:

---

#### MODE A: Loss Recovery (First Trade = LOSS)

When the first trade loses, enter a **4-trade recovery sequence** with decreasing position sizes:

```
Trade 1: R$500 risk  (always LOSS - this triggers the mode)
Trade 2: R$250 risk  (50% of trade 1)
Trade 3: R$125 risk  (50% of trade 2)
Trade 4: R$125 risk  (same as trade 3 - FINAL, stop regardless of result)
```

**Key rule:** All 4 trades are executed regardless of intermediate results. After trade 4, the day is over for this sequence.

**Maximum loss:** 500 + 250 + 125 + 125 = **R$1,000** (matches daily limit exactly)

---

#### MODE B: Gain Compounding (First Trade = GAIN)

When the first trade wins, continue trading with **30% of accumulated gains as risk** until one of:

1. **Accumulated gains >= R$1,500** --> Stop (daily target hit)
2. **A LOSS occurs** --> Stop (you keep 70% of accumulated gains)

```
Trade 1: Risk R$500, WIN (+R$500 * RR)     --> accumulated = gain. Check target.
Trade 2: Risk = 30% of accumulated gains    --> WIN? add to accumulated. Check target.
Trade 3: Risk = 30% of NEW accumulated      --> WIN? add to accumulated. Check target.
...continues until LOSS or target reached
```

**On LOSS:** You lose only 30% of accumulated gains. The remaining 70% is yours for the day.

**The cycle repeats:** WIN --> update accumulated --> check target --> calculate 30% risk --> next trade.

---

## 2. Loss Recovery Mode - All 8 Paths

After the first trade (always LOSS at R$500), trades 2-4 each produce either a LOSS or GAIN. This creates **8 possible paths** (2^3 = 8):

| Path | Trade 2 | Trade 3 | Trade 4 | Pattern |
|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 1    | LOSS    | LOSS    | LOSS    | L-L-L-L |
| 2    | LOSS    | LOSS    | GAIN    | L-L-L-G |
| 3    | LOSS    | GAIN    | LOSS    | L-L-G-L |
| 4    | LOSS    | GAIN    | GAIN    | L-L-G-G |
| 5    | GAIN    | LOSS    | LOSS    | L-G-L-L |
| 6    | GAIN    | LOSS    | GAIN    | L-G-L-G |
| 7    | GAIN    | GAIN    | LOSS    | L-G-G-L |
| 8    | GAIN    | GAIN    | GAIN    | L-G-G-G |

### Path Probability Formula

For a given Win Rate (WR), the probability of each path depends on which trades are wins (W) vs losses (L) in trades 2-4:

```
P(path) = WR^(number of wins in trades 2-4) * (1-WR)^(number of losses in trades 2-4)
```

### Path Result Formula

For a given Reward:Risk ratio (RR), each trade produces:
- **LOSS:** -trade_size
- **GAIN:** +trade_size * RR

```
Result = -500 + Σ(trade_i outcome)
```

Where trade sizes are: [500, 250, 125, 125] and trade 1 is always LOSS.

---

## 3. Gain Compounding Mode - Path Analysis

**Rule:** After the first WIN, each subsequent trade risks **30% of accumulated gains**. On a loss, you keep the remaining 70%.

### How It Works Step by Step

```
accumulated = first_win_amount          (R$500 * RR)
LOOP:
  if accumulated >= 1500 → STOP (target hit)
  risk = 0.30 * accumulated
  take trade:
    WIN  → accumulated += risk * RR     (gains grow)
    LOSS → accumulated -= risk          (lose 30%, keep 70%)
           STOP
```

### Gain Mode Walkthrough: R:R 1:1.5

| Step | Accumulated | Risk (30%) | If WIN (+risk*1.5)| If LOSS (keep 70%) |
|------|------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| T1 WIN | R$750    | —         | —                 | —                 |
| T2     | R$750    | R$225     | acc = R$1,087.50  | keep R$525        |
| T3     | R$1,087.50| R$326.25 | acc = R$1,576.88  | keep R$761.25     |

Target hit after 3 consecutive wins (+R$1,577). On loss at any step, you still walk away positive.

### Gain Mode Walkthrough: R:R 1:1

| Step | Accumulated | Risk (30%) | If WIN (+risk*1)  | If LOSS (keep 70%) |
|------|------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| T1 WIN | R$500    | —         | —                 | —                 |
| T2     | R$500    | R$150     | acc = R$650       | keep R$350        |
| T3     | R$650    | R$195     | acc = R$845       | keep R$455        |
| T4     | R$845    | R$253.50  | acc = R$1,098.50  | keep R$591.50     |
| T5     | R$1,098.50| R$329.55 | acc = R$1,428.05  | keep R$768.95     |
| T6     | R$1,428.05| R$428.42 | acc = R$1,856.47  | keep R$999.63     |

Target hit after 6 consecutive wins (+R$1,856). Needs more wins but risk is always controlled.

### Wins to Target by R:R

| R:R   | 1st Win    | Wins to Target | P(Target) at 65% WR | P(Target) at 45% WR |
|-------|-----------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1:4   | R$2,000   | 1 (instant)    | 65.0%               | 45.0%               |
| 1:3   | R$1,500   | 1 (instant)    | 65.0%               | 45.0%               |
| 1:1.5 | R$750     | 3              | 42.3%               | 9.1%                |
| 1:1   | R$500     | 6              | 7.5%                | 0.8%                |
| 1:0.8 | R$400     | 8              | 2.3%                | 0.2%                |
| 1:0.5 | R$250     | 14             | 0.1%                | ~0%                 |
| 1:0.3 | R$150     | 25+            | ~0%                 | ~0%                 |

### Key Safety Property

**You can never lose your entire day's gains in gain mode.** A loss only takes 30% of accumulated gains. Even the worst-case gain-mode outcome (1 WIN then immediate LOSS) leaves you with 70% of your first win:

```
Worst gain-mode outcome = first_win * 0.70 = R$500 * RR * 0.70
```

| R:R  | First Win | Worst Gain-Mode Outcome (1W, 1L) |
|------|----------|----------------------------------|
| 1:4  | R$2,000  | +R$2,000 (target hit, no T2)     |
| 1:3  | R$1,500  | +R$1,500 (target hit, no T2)     |
| 1:1.5| R$750    | +R$525                           |
| 1:1  | R$500    | +R$350                           |
| 1:0.8| R$400    | +R$280                           |
| 1:0.5| R$250    | +R$175                           |
| 1:0.3| R$150    | +R$105                           |

#### Gain Compounding Paths (30% risk rule, need 6 wins — same structure as Profile 4)

| Step | Accumulated | Risk (30%) | If LOSS (keep 70%) | P(stop here) |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|

| 6W target | — | — | **+R$1,857** | 3.13% |

**E[Gain Mode] = 0.50(350) + 0.25(455) + 0.125(592) + 0.0625(769) + 0.0313(1000) + 0.0313(1857) = +R$447.70**

#### Daily Expected Value

```
E[day] = 0.50 * R$447.70 + 0.50 * (-R$500) = -R$26.15
Monthly (22 days): -R$575
```

**Now clearly negative.** The 30% rule is safer but can't manufacture an edge where none exists.

**E[Loss Mode] = -R$460.00**

*Note: Every single path in loss mode is negative. Even the best case (L-G-G-G) still loses R$100.*

#### Gain Compounding Paths (30% risk rule, need 8 wins for target)

Growth per win: accumulated * (1 + 0.30 * 0.8) = accumulated * 1.24

| Step | Accumulated | Risk (30%) | If LOSS (keep 70%) | P(stop here) |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| T1 W | R$400     | —         | —                 | —           |

| T8   | R$1,454   | R$436     | **+R$1,018**      | 1.87%       |
| 8W target | R$1,803 | — | **+R$1,803**      | 2.80%       |

**Every outcome in gain mode is positive** — the 30% rule means you always keep 70% of gains on a loss.

**E[Gain Mode] = +R$432.78**

#### Daily Expected Value

```
E[day] = 0.60 * R$432.78 + 0.40 * (-R$460) = +R$75.67
Monthly (22 days): +R$1,665
```

**Fragile.** Thin edge, needs 8 consecutive wins for target (2.8% chance). One bad week wipes the month.

---

### PROFILE 7: WR 80% + R:R 1:0.3 (Bad - Illusory Win Rate)

**Per-trade:** Win = R$150 | Loss = R$500 | PF = 1.20

*Note: The per-trade expectancy is technically positive (+R$20), but the management system exposes how fragile this is.*

#### Loss Recovery Paths

| Path    | T1     | T2     | T3      | T4      | **Result**      | Prob   |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|---------|----------------|--------|
| L-L-L-L | -500   | -250   | -125    | -125    | **-R$1,000.00**    | 0.80%  |
| L-L-L-G | -500   | -250   | -125    | +37.50  | **-R$837.50**      | 3.20%  |
| L-L-G-L | -500   | -250   | +37.50  | -125    | **-R$837.50**      | 3.20%  |
| L-L-G-G | -500   | -250   | +37.50  | +37.50  | **-R$675.00**      | 12.80% |
| L-G-L-L | -500   | +75    | -125    | -125    | **-R$675.00**      | 3.20%  |
| L-G-L-G | -500   | +75    | -125    | +37.50  | **-R$512.50**      | 12.80% |
| L-G-G-L | -500   | +75    | +37.50  | -125    | **-R$512.50**      | 12.80% |
| L-G-G-G | -500   | +75    | +37.50  | +37.50  | **-R$350.00**      | 51.20% |

**E[Loss Mode] = -R$480.00**

*Every single path is a loss. Even the "best" case (3 wins) still loses R$350. The tiny R:R means wins cannot offset the initial R$500 loss.*

#### Gain Compounding Paths (30% risk rule, need ~27 wins for target!)

Growth per win: accumulated * (1 + 0.30 * 0.3) = accumulated * **1.09**

With R:R 0.3, gains compound at only 9% per win. Starting from R$150, reaching R$1,500 requires approximately **27 consecutive wins** (P = 0.80^26 = 0.24%).

| Step    | If LOSS (keep 70%) | P(stop here) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1W, 1L  | **+R$105**        | 20.00%      |
| 2W, 1L  | **+R$114**        | 16.00%      |
| 5W, 1L  | **+R$153**        | 6.55%       |
| 10W, 1L | **+R$235**        | 2.15%       |
| 20W, 1L | **+R$556**        | 0.23%       |
| 27W target | **+R$1,537**   | 0.24%       |

**With 30% rule, every outcome is at least +R$105** — no more net losses in gain mode. But growth is painfully slow: after 10 consecutive wins you've only accumulated R$336.

**E[Gain Mode] = +R$163.72**

#### Daily Expected Value

```
E[day] = 0.80 * R$163.72 + 0.20 * (-R$480) = +R$34.98
Monthly (22 days): +R$770
```

**Essentially dead money.** Technically positive, but fees erase it. The 30% rule protects you from net losses in gain mode (unlike fixed R$500 risk), but can't fix the core problem: R:R 1:0.3 grows too slowly to ever reach target.

---

### PROFILE 8: WR 35% + R:R 1:1 (Bad - No Edge)

**Per-trade:** Win = R$500 | Loss = R$500 | PF = 0.54

#### Loss Recovery Paths

| Path    | T1     | T2     | T3     | T4     | **Result**      | Prob   |

| L-G-G-G | -500   | +250   | +125   | +125   | **R$0.00**         | 4.29%  |

**E[Loss Mode] = -R$650.00**

*Worst loss mode of all profiles. 27.46% chance of maximum -R$1,000 loss. Only 4.29% chance of breaking even.*

#### Gain Compounding Paths (30% risk rule, need 6 wins — same structure as Profile 4)

| Step | Accumulated | Risk (30%) | If LOSS (keep 70%) | P(stop here) |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| T2   | R$500     | R$150     | **+R$350**        | 65.00%      |
| T3   | R$650     | R$195     | **+R$455**        | 22.75%      |
| T4   | R$845     | R$253.50  | **+R$592**        | 7.96%       |
| T5   | R$1,099   | R$329.55  | **+R$769**        | 2.79%       |
| T6   | R$1,428   | R$428.42  | **+R$1,000**      | 0.98%       |
| 6W target | — | — | **+R$1,857** | 0.53% |

65% of gain-mode entries stop with +R$350 (still positive with 30% rule). Only 0.53% reach target.

**E[Gain Mode] = +R$419.08**

#### Daily Expected Value

```
E[day] = 0.35 * R$419.08 + 0.65 * (-R$650) = -R$275.82
Monthly (22 days): -R$6,068
```

**Still hits monthly risk limit.** The 30% rule makes gain mode always positive, but 65% loss rate makes loss mode dominate.

### PROFILE 9: WR 55% + R:R 1:0.5 (Bad - Slow Bleed)

**Per-trade:** Win = R$250 | Loss = R$500 | PF = 0.61

#### Loss Recovery Paths

**E[Loss Mode] = -R$587.50**

*Every single path is a loss. Best case still loses R$250.*

#### Gain Compounding Paths (30% risk rule, need ~14 wins for target)

Growth per win: accumulated * (1 + 0.30 * 0.5) = accumulated * **1.15**

Starting from R$250, reaching R$1,500 requires ~13 additional wins (P = 0.55^13 = 0.04%).

| Step    | If LOSS (keep 70%) | P(stop here) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1W, 1L  | **+R$175**        | 45.00%      |
| 2W, 1L  | **+R$201**        | 24.75%      |
| 3W, 1L  | **+R$232**        | 13.61%      |
| 5W, 1L  | **+R$306**        | 4.12%       |
| 10W, 1L | **+R$617**        | 0.34%       |
| 14W target | **+R$1,523**   | 0.04%       |

**With 30% rule: all outcomes are positive** (minimum +R$175). But target is nearly unreachable — 45% of entries stop at first loss with just +R$175.

**E[Gain Mode] = +R$213.72**

#### Daily Expected Value

```
E[day] = 0.55 * R$213.72 + 0.45 * (-R$587.50) = -R$146.83
Monthly (22 days): -R$3,230
```

**Still bleeding, but slower.** The 30% rule improved gain mode significantly (all outcomes positive vs. 45% net-loss before), but the negative-expectancy loss mode still dominates.

## 6. Risk Limit Impact Analysis

### Days Until Weekly Limit (R$2,000)

Worst case per day = -R$1,000 (all 4 losses in recovery mode).

| Profile | Worst Day  | Days to Weekly Limit | Days to Monthly Limit |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| All     | -R$1,000  | 2 days              | 7.5 days             |

But expected days to hit limits differ by profile:

| Profile | Avg Loss Days | Expected Weekly Drawdown | Weeks to Monthly Limit |
|---------|--------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| 1 (65%, 1:1.5) | -R$187.50 | ~10.7 loss-days needed | Unlikely to hit   |
| 8 (35%, 1:1)   | -R$650.00 | ~3.1 loss-days needed  | ~2.4 weeks         |
| 9 (55%, 1:0.5) | -R$587.50 | ~3.4 loss-days needed  | ~2.6 weeks         |

## 7. Key Takeaways

### Does the Management System Make Sense?

**Yes, the core design is sound:**

1. **Anti-Martingale on losses** (500 -> 250 -> 125 -> 125): Reducing size after losses is the mathematically correct approach. Traditional martingale (doubling after losses) leads to ruin. This does the opposite.

2. **Maximum daily loss is hard-capped** at R$1,000 (500+250+125+125), which matches the stated daily limit exactly. Good design.

3. **Asymmetric daily R:R**: Max daily loss = R$1,000, daily gain target = R$1,500. This creates a built-in 1:1.5 risk-reward at the day level.

4. **30% risk in gain mode**: You only risk 30% of accumulated gains per subsequent trade. On a loss, you keep 70%. This means gain mode can never produce a net-negative day — the worst case is keeping 70% of your first win.

5. **Stop-on-first-loss in gain mode**: Protects accumulated intraday gains from being given back.

### Critical Insights from the Simulation

1. **The management system cannot save a bad strategy.** Profiles 8 and 9 lose money regardless of the protective rules. No amount of position sizing fixes negative per-trade expectancy.

2. **The 30% risk rule is a game-changer for gain mode.** Unlike flat R$500 risk, you can never lose more than 30% of accumulated gains — every gain-mode outcome is positive. This eliminates the old problem where gain mode could produce net losses.

3. **High R:R strategies (2, 3) benefit enormously** because a single WIN can hit the daily target immediately. No need for compounding at all — one trade and you're done.

4. **With the 30% rule, high R:R now clearly dominates.** Profiles 2 and 3 top the rankings because they hit target in 1 trade. Profile 1 (1:1.5) needs 3 wins, Profile 4 (1:1) needs 6 wins — the 30% rule slows compounding compared to flat risk but adds safety.

5. **Profile 7 is essentially dead money.** With R:R 1:0.3, accumulated gains grow at only 9% per win. Target requires ~27 consecutive wins (P = 0.24%). Daily E of +R$35 is wiped by any fees.

6. **The borderline zone (Profiles 5-6) is death by a thousand cuts.** The edge is too small to survive real-world friction (fees, slippage, missed fills, emotional errors).

### Execution Constraints Impact

The **minimum stop of 100 points** and **maximum of 20 contracts** create practical boundaries:

1. **At tight stops (100pt):** Trade 1 and gain-mode trades are capped at 20 contracts, which may reduce effective risk below R$500. The system still works — the cap just acts as an additional safety layer.

2. **At wider stops (200pt+):** Contract counts naturally stay well under 20. The constraint is non-binding. Risk amounts are fully utilized.

3. **Loss recovery trades (T2-T4):** With smaller risk amounts (R$250, R$125), these trades naturally use fewer contracts and are unlikely to hit the 20-contract cap at any reasonable stop distance.

4. **The 100-point minimum stop prevents over-leveraging.** Without this floor, a 20-point stop at R$500 risk would require 125 contracts — absurd and dangerous. The floor ensures position sizes remain sensible.

### Minimum Viable Strategy for This Management System

For this risk management framework to be meaningfully profitable:
- **PF must be above ~1.5** (theoretical, before costs)
- **The product WR * (1 + RR) must be significantly above 1.0**
- **Aim for E[day] > +R$300** to have meaningful buffer against costs and bad variance
