## Plan Terms Explained

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Meta Aprovação** | Net profit target to pass the evaluation (after all fees/costs) |
| **Referência Diária** | Suggested daily reference — NOT mandatory, just a guideline |
| **Perda Diária** | Max allowed loss in a single day. Hitting it triggers automatic stopper — no more trades that day |
| **Perda Total** | Max allowed cumulative loss during the 30-day evaluation. Hitting it = **immediate disqualification** |
| **Máximo Contratos** | Max contracts held simultaneously in any single position |

---

## Consistency Proof (Prova de Consistência)

1. **Minimum 10 trading days** before submitting results for approval
2. If meta is reached in **fewer than 6 days**, you must continue trading until 10 days are completed
3. Results of remaining days (after meta was reached) must average **at least 50%** of the average daily result that led to hitting the meta
4. **No single day** can represent more than **50% of the Meta Aprovação**. Excess is NOT counted toward the meta (you are not eliminated — the extra just doesn't count)

---

## General Conditions (All Plans)

- **Evaluation period:** 30 calendar days from start
- **Operating hours:** All positions forcibly closed at **17:00** by the risk desk, regardless of P&L
- **All results are NET** of registration fees, emolumentos, and brokerage (corretagem)
- **Failure conditions:**
  - Reaching 100% Perda Total → disqualified
  - Not reaching Meta within 30 days → disqualified (even if net positive)
  - Reaching Perda Total without trading 10 days and without notifying TSR → eliminated
- **After disqualification:** Can request a new evaluation after the current 30-day period ends. Within 6 months of the first test, retests in the same plan only require platform costs
- **After approval:** Validated via Resultado Líquido Total from Nelogica Profit Performance Report. TSR validates within 2 business days. Trader starts on simulated funded desk first
